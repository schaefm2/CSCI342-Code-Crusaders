# note on HOTELS

Hotels uses a google test search engine api for the hotel images,
we only get 50 requests a day on it.
Email me schaefm2@wwu.edu so I can replace with static images and keep functionality
if the hotel images do not appear like in the video,

# Videos

See max_schaefer.mp4 for working hotel using the google api

# Functionality notes

Some issues I couldnt solve with with adding flighs and hotels to a trip.
Dont make trips of the same name...
Make two trips... Idk how to make the selector for initialize to a state. Yes i tried useState, and put in a useEffect and waited after a repo call to make sure i had trips.
